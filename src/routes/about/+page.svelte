<p> 
Scade stands for <b>System for Climate Alerts, Disasters, and Emergencies</b>.<br>
Our mission is to build a sustainable weather API platform. <br>
The lack of a pre-existing system within the New Zealand government inspired us to develop this application. <br>
</p>
<p>
  This website is designed for the use of New Zealand emergency responders. <br>
  Scade may also be applicable to relevant responders such as council members.
